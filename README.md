# Prediction of Product Sales

## Overview
This project aims to predict product sales using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project contains information about various products and their sales over a period of time.

## Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: The first step in the project involves cleaning the dataset to prepare it for analysis and modeling. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data formats.

2. **Visualization with Seaborn**: After cleaning the data, we use the Seaborn library to create visualizations that help in understanding the relationships between different variables and identifying patterns in the data.

## Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process involves the following steps:
- Handling missing values: Any missing values in the dataset are imputed or removed based on the nature of the data.
- Removing duplicates: Duplicate rows, if any, are identified and removed from the dataset.
- Correcting data formats: Data types of columns are adjusted as needed to ensure consistency and accuracy.

## Visualization using Seaborn
In the Colab notebook, we use Seaborn to create various visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps to explore the dataset and gain insights into the relationships between different features.
